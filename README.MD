#Stellarbeat frontend 

## Install
`yarn install`

development: 
`yarn run serve` 

production:
`yarn run build`

## Quorum Monitor
### Explore
Explore and gain insight on the network through various visualisations & analysis.
### simulate
Adapt the network by updating quorumSets, adding/removing nodes, toggling nodes on/off and see the results live in the browser. 
### export
- quorum set configurations
- network simulation results

# Stellarbeat Architecture
Nodejs modules that can be reused on frontend and backend. This should provide us with a manageable/reusable codebase and allow us to simulate/process live in the browser and push heavier computations to the backend. 
## Modules
### domain
Domain classes like node, quorumset, network
### connector
General purpose library that connects the stellar-core and can issue commands
### crawler
Uses the connector to crawl the network
### stellarbeat backend
Initiates the crawler and augments the nodes with statistics (uptime,...) and other data like displayname, location,...
Provides persistent storage. Provides api
Exposes the nodes & analytic processes. e.g. 

`GET /nodes/{publicKey}`

`POST /compute/quorum-intersection`

### stellarbeat frontend
Frontend that contains various visualisations and tools like quorum monitor, node map, node version pie chart,...
